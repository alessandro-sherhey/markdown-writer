# markdown-writer

## Description
This web app allows you to write Markdown directly into your browser, while allowing you to easily download or copy what you wrote.

I know that there are way better editors than mine, but I still wanted to make this to practice my React and Redux skills, and to try out the `ant-design` UI components.

## Features
* Live preview of your Markdown
* Functions for quickly adding characters such as asterisks or tildes to style your text
* Keyboard shortcuts *(on Mac they're limited)*
* Download your Markdown in a .md file
* Copy your Markdown in the clipboard

## Technologies

* React Markdown
* Ant Design
